    <h1>Andy Warhol's dang Career</h1>
    <br />
    <p>
      After graduating from art school with a degree in pictorial design, Warhol
      moved to New York City to pursue a career as a commercial artist, and he
      dropped the final “a” in Warhola. He moved with fellow classmate Philip
      Pearlstein and created a circle of close-knit friends including college
      friend Leila Davies Singeles and dancer Francesca Boas. His work first
      appeared in a 1949 issue of Glamour magazine, in which he illustrated a
      story called “What is Success?” An award-winning illustrator throughout
      the 1950s, some of his clients included Tiffany & Co., I. Miller Shoes,
      Fleming-Joffe, Bonwit Teller, Columbia Records, and Vogue.

      Warhol self-published a large series of artist’s books in the 1950s. He
      would hold parties at Serendipity 3, a restaurant and ice cream parlor on
      Manhattan’s Upper East Side, where his friends would help him hand color
      his books. In 1956, he presented a solo exhibition at the Bodley Gallery
      called Studies for a Boy Book. These sketchbook drawings of portraits of
      young men and erotic portrayals of male nudes contrasted with the work of
      other contemporary gay artists, such as Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper
      Johns, who considered Warhol “too swish.”

      As equally as he was an artist, Warhol was an entrepreneur. He kickstarted
      his career in the 1950s as a commercial illustrator, earning a sizeable
      revenue to finance his artistic ventures. Warhol grew up during the rise
      of post-war consumer culture in the U.S. and England and realized the
      benefit of assembly lines in manufacturing, employing studio assistants
      and processes to aid his artistic production. Warhol successfully balanced
      commercial and entrepreneurial endeavors with avant-garde, underground
      work. He continually pushed himself to experiment in new media—publishing,
      film, music production, television, fashion, theater—throughout his career
      and frequently collaborated with artists and brands. Warhol wrote in THE
      Philosophy of Andy Warhol (From A to B and Back Again), “Being good in
      business is the most fascinating kind of art. Making money is art and
      working is art and good business is the best art.”

      Warhol became increasingly involved in publishing in the late 1960s,
      becoming fully immersed in the 1970s. In 1969, he co-founded Interview, a
      magazine devoted to film, fashion, and popular culture that gave him
      access to the stars. He published his first mass-produced book, Andy
      Warhol’s Index (Book), in 1967, and THE Philosophy of Andy Warhol (From A
      to B and Back Again) was published in 1975. Published posthumously in
      1989, The Andy Warhol Diaries chronicle his daily life from November 24,
      1976, through February 17, 1987, five days before he died; his assistant
      and friend Pat Hackett transcribed their daily phone conversations
      detailing the previous day’s events.

      Warhol was infatuated with Hollywood celebrity and fame since childhood.
      He wrote to movie stars for headshots and fan photos, assembling
      scrapbooks between 1938 and 1941. In the 1960s, The Factory became a
      hangout for artists, musicians, and writers, including Lou Reed, Bob
      Dylan, Truman Capote, and many more. Warhol’s Superstars, including Edie
      Sedgwick, Brigid Berlin, Ondine, and Candy Darling, were Factory goers who
      appeared in his films and became fixtures in his social life. In the
      1970s, Warhol was a regular at the New York disco Studio 54, and he
      received hundreds of portrait commissions from wealthy socialites,
      musicians, and film stars. He remained in the spotlight in the 1980s with
      his television work and high-fashion modeling. Warhol achieved stardom,
      and helped others do the same, realizing his expression, “In the future,
      everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes.”
