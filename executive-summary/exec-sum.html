            <p>Andy was born in Pittsburgh, PA and died at New York Hospital in New York City, NY.  Throughout his life he travelled all across the world, however, he would always dutifully return home to the US after each trip.  His parents humble beginnings in the United
                States began when they emigrated to the USA from Ruthenia.  From 1945-1949 he studied at the Carnegia Institute of Technology and moved to New York upon his completion of college and offically changed his name to Warhol.  His career jumpstarted in the 1960's
                as he began to experiment with reproductions based on advertisements, newspaper headlines and other mass-produced images from American popular culture such as Campbell's soup tins.
